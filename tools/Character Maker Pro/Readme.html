        February 1st, 2013</p>
    <p>After way too long, translation version 1.00 has finally been released. The majority of changes were made back in December, I unfortunately didn't have the time until recently to finish the rest I had discovered or were reported. I believe I made all the final tweaks and changes I've wanted so any update going forward will most likely be word changes and such. Of course all feedback and suggestions are welcomed so let me know what you think. </p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Known Bugs/Problems: </strong></p>
      <p>Problem: Weird spacing in help strings.<br />
        Reason: This is intentional for the time being until I've decided on the proper wording as once I make the change I cannot undo it. 
      </p>
      <p>Problem: Word abbreviations.<br />
      Reason: The Japanese language as we all know is very different then English and while we may need 4 spaces for the word right they would only need 2. In those types of situation, which there were quite a few I was forced to make compromises and used RT for right. Because of this limitation I've included a list of abbreviations I used and what they actually mean. <br />

      <p>Q: The font is messed up and everything is miss-aligned! <br />
        A: Make sure the MS UI Gothic font is installed as it's required by Character Maker Pro to run properly, navigate to &quot;C:\Windows\Fonts&quot; and check if it’s there. If not, go into your Character Maker Pro install directory and in the &quot;Extras&quot; folder copy it over &quot;msgothi0.ttc&quot; to &quot;C:\Windows\Fonts&quot;.</p>
